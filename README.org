*Warning:* Nix on darwin, especially on arm, is a work in progress. Be prepared to encounter bugs and weird behavior. Packages might take a while to randomly build from souce (the offender is usually GHC), and packages on master regularly break. Feel free to open an issue if you run into problems, and I'll try my best to fix it.

* Installing and notes

** Linux 
NOTE: Don't use this unless you know what you're doing. You're likely here for the MacOS flake, if so just skip on ahead!
#+begin_src sh
nix-shell -p nixUnstable git
nixos-install --flake https://github.com/shaunsingh/nix-darwin-dotfiles#shaunsingh-thinkpad
#+end_src

** MacOS 
*NOTE: These are available as an executable script [[./extra/install.sh]]*
Install Nix. I have it setup for multi-user, but you can remove the =--daemon= if you want a single user install
    #+begin_src sh :comments both :tangle "./extra/install.sh" :shebang "#!/bin/bash"
    sh <(curl -L https://nixos.org/nix/install) --daemon
    #+end_src
Tangle the =.org= files (not needed, but recommend in case I forgot to update tangled files)
    #+begin_src sh :comments both :tangle "./extra/install.sh" :shebang "#!/bin/bash"
    git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/shaunsingh/nix-darwin-dotfiles.git ~/nix-darwin-dotfiles/ && cd ~/nix-darwin-dotfiles
    emacs --batch --eval "(progn (require 'org) (setq org-confirm-babel-evaluate nil) (org-babel-tangle-file \"~/nix-darwin-dotfiles/nix-config.org\"))"
    emacs --batch --eval "(progn (require 'org) (setq org-confirm-babel-evaluate nil) (org-babel-tangle-file \"~/nix-darwin-dotfiles/configs/doom/config.org\"))"
    #+end_src
	(if emacs asks you for comment syntax, put `# ` for everything)
Build, and switch to the dotfiles
    #+begin_src sh :comments both :tangle "./extra/install.sh" :shebang "#!/bin/bash"
    nix build ~/nix-darwin-dotfiles\#darwinConfigurations.shaunsingh-laptop.system --extra-experimental-features nix-command --extra-experimental-features flakes
    ./result/sw/bin/darwin-rebuild switch --flake .#shaunsingh-laptop
    #+end_src
(note, =--extra-experimental-features= is only needed the first time around. After that the configuration will edit =/etc/nix/nix.conf= to enable flakes and nix-command by default)
